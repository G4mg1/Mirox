Mirox Mobile License (Version 1.0, June 2024)

Preamble

The Mirox Mobile License is a free, copyleft license for mobile applications intended for use on Samsung or Android phones. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the Mirox Mobile License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a mobile application--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the authors of the Mirox Mobile License, use it to protect your rights, but you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification

"You" refers to any individual or entity that exercises rights under this License.

"Distribution" means providing the Application or a copy thereof to a third party, including via app stores.

You must provide the Source Code of the Application or make it available in a public repository when you distribute the Application or any derivative works.

3. Modifications and Derivative Works

You may modify your copy or copies of the Application or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Application, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1, provided that you also meet all these conditions:
   a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Application or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   b. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Application or derivative work.
   c. Distribution must be limited to Samsung or Android mobile devices, and any distribution through app stores must comply with their terms and conditions, provided those terms do not conflict with the freedoms granted by this License.

7. Limitation of Liability

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any author be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Application.

8. Acceptance

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Application or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Application, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
